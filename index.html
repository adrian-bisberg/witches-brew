            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Witches’ Brew introduces a novel type of integrity attack wherein a model is trained from scratch using tampered
                data in order to target a specific image for misclassification. Authors are motivated by creating an integrity attack
                that improves upon previous work to target larger scale models and work with minimal amounts of poisoned training
                data. The technique used in their attack is called gradient matching. Here, authors find that the attacker may 
                mimic the gradient of the target by creating poisoned data whose training gradient aligns with the gradient of 
                an adversarial target. The authors define a threat model of an attacker who can control a limited amount of the training
                data, cannot modify labels of the training data, and has knowledge of model parameters but not entire details of the 
                model architecture.
