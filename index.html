    <h1 class="blog-title">An Analysis of: Witches’ Brew: Industrial Scale Data Poisoning Via Gradient Matching
    </h1>

    <h4> by Adrian Bisberg and Evan Rose </h4>

    <section class="blog-section magic-box" id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Witches' Brew introduces a novel type of integrity attack where a model is trained from scratch using tampered
        data in order to target a specific image for misclassification. The authors are motivated by creating an integrity attack
        that improves upon previous work to target larger scale models and work with minimal amounts of poisoned training
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technique used in their attack is called gradient matching. Here, the attacker
        mimics the gradient of the target by creating poisoned data whose training gradient aligns with the gradient of
        an adversarial target.
      </p>

      <p>
        The authors define a threat model of an attacker who can control a limited amount of the training
        data, cannot modify labels of the training data, and has knowledge of model parameters but not entire details of the
        model architecture.
      </p>

      <figure class="fig1">
        <img src="media/poisoning_overview.png" alt="An overview of the poisoning procedure" class="centered-image">
        <figcaption class="figcaption1">The attack perturbs a small set of data (around 0.1% in authors experiments)
          in an imperceptable manner using parameter information from a pre-trained model. The poisoned data is then fed back for
          from-scratch training, and when the target image is checked for classification, the adversarial label is given.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The data poisoning attack can be viewed as a bilevel optimization problem, where the poison perturbation &Theta; is optimized
        to enforce the malicious label onto target data, while the solution to the inner problem still minimizes the original
        training objective of the model. Given P poisoned images by adding a perturbation \(\Delta\) to each image, the modification is
        constrained by the \(\ell_{\infty}\)-norm to be no less than hyperparameter \(\varepsilon\). Within this constraint the goal
        is to enforce similarity between the adversarial loss on targeted data \(x_t\) (left side of equation) and the
        training loss on poisoned data (right side of equation):
      </p>

      <figure class="fig1">
        \[\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(F(x^t, \theta), y^{\mathrm{adv}}) \approx \frac{1}{P} \sum_{i=1}^P \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(F(x_i + \Delta_i, \theta), y_i) \]
        <figcaption class="figcaption1"> On the left side: the loss between adversarial label to predicted label of the targeted image. The goal is to minimize This
          loss in order to misclassify the target image as the adversarial label. On the right side: the loss described between
          predicted label of poisoned data and its original label. Minimizing this loss maintains the validation accuracy of the model to
          keep the attack imperceptible.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- <figure class="fig1">
        <img src="media/matching_gradient_eq.png" class="centered-image">
      </figure> -->

      <p>
        Note: Here, authors decide to use a single target image x<sub>t</sub> for their experiments but mentioned multiple could be included
        at once. However evidence of the effectiveness of using the method for multiple targets is not strong.
      </p>

      </p>
      In order to align the target and the poison gradients in the same direction, the attack minimizes the cosine similarity between them using
      signed Adam updates with a decaying step size. In this formulation, the model parameters \(\theta\) are not changed, instead \(\Delta_i\) is calculated in order to find the optimal poison to force misclassification. This method is particularly novel as it only requires a time budget of a single epoch, and the differentiation of the loss only requires a smaller subset of poisoned images P, rather than the entire
      data set.Authors additionally give theoretical grounds for their method by invoking a proof using "Zoutendij" (as defined in Nocedal &
      Wright, 2006) to show that their bilevel gradient descent will converge locally.
      </p>

      <figure class="fig1">

        <figcaption class="figcaption1"> Plotting the cosine similarity across training epochs, comparing the poisoned image set versus the unmodified

          a positive similarity throughout training.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Because the threat model of the attack does not give full knowledge of the model architecture, such as dropout layers, hyperparameters, data
        augmentation, etc, the authors propose several techniques to make to attack more robust to varying architecture:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Data augmentation - at each minimization step, randomly draw a translation crop, and possibly flip for each poisoned image. Creates
          increased transferability and robustness to possible data augmentations within the model.
        </li>
        <li>
          Restarts - minimize the cosine similarity several times using different random starting perturbations, then select the captured alignment loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Model Ensembles - optimize the attack over an ensemble of different models, increasing generalized performance at a high computational cost.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Authors display results for the accuracy of the poisoned data set in comparison to similar methods, as well as transfer results
        that test on models that were not used for training the poisoned data set.

          poisoning from the same category. Models trained using ResNet-18 are evaluated next to other model architectures to

      <h2>History and Related Works</h2>
      <p>
        Data poisoning attacks against machine learning extend back at least as early as the 2000s, when security researchers were interested in manipulating email spam filters (<a href="#cite-nelson2008">Nelson et al., 2008</a>). This was a time before deep learning had gained traction in practical applications, so these attacks typically targeted simple classifiers, such as logistic regression or SVM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between 2012 and 2014, a number of works developed gradient-based attacks against classification, including against neural networks. <a href="#cite-biggio2012">Biggio et al.</a> (2012) used gradient methods to craft poisoned data that increases SVM test error. Around the same time, <a href="#cite-biggio2013">Biggio et al.</a> (2013) and <a href="#cite-szegedy2014">Szegedy et al.</a> (2014) used gradient methods to evade machine learning classifiers by perturbing test instances in imperceptible ways. This early work sparked a flurry of work on understanding the robustness properties of machine learning systems, especially deep neural networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern work on poisoning has advanced to become much more effective and stealthy. For example, the early backdoor poisoning attack by <a href="#cite-gu2017">Gu et al.</a> (2017), which assumed an attacker with the ability to arbitrarily change training data, was soon refined to include versions in which the attacker does not need the ability to modify data labels (<a href="#cite-turner2019">Turner et al., 2019</a>) or reveal the backdoor trigger inside the training data (<a href="#cite-saha2020">Saha et al., 2020</a>). Other attacks targeted the transfer learning setting (<a href="#cite-shafahi2018">Shafahi et al, 2018</a>; <a href="#cite-zhu2019">Zhu et al., 2019</a>) by crafting poisons that behavior anomolously in the learned represenatation space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, practitioners consider poisoning attacks to be among the most serious threats to machine learning security (<a href="#cite-sivakumar2020">Kumar et al., 2020</a>). This is because modern machine learning typically relies on collecting massive amounts of training data, often from untrusted sources and on such a large scale that manual data cleaning is impossible.

      <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Data poisoning attacks pose a serious security threat to the integrity of learning systems. The authors of Witches' Brew point out
        the ideal type of poising attack includes imperceptible changes to images, minimal amounts of modified training data, and
        no significant effect to the validation accuracy of the system. In machine learning systems that rely on large amounts of web scraped data,
        attacks like Witches' Brew can easily be injected into several training cycles over time, making the attack both hard to detect
        and difficult to fix. There are always qualifications to the feasibility of an adversarial attack; for Witches' Brew the attack
        does depend on availability of the trained model and access to contributing training data. This means the attack would be more effective
        against a continual learning model or a reinforcement based model.
      </p>

      <p>
        Model integrity attacks have larger social implications by providing a means to bypass important safety measures that the model is
        trying to ensure. For example, an important measure taken in a large model could be to identify explicit or violent content, and a
        data poisoning attack could force malicious classification of certain outputs as safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other types of adversarial attacks pose additional threats to model security. In a model extraction attack, the attacker uses queries of the
        model and observed outputs in order to assemble a duplicate of a previously private model. Model inversion attacks can reveal information from the
        data set that was used to train the model, and potentially compromise private information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Research into adversarial attacks is useful for identifying model vulnerabilities to different types of attacks and evaluating the
        effectiveness of various defensive strategies. When models are built with increased knowledge of different attacks, security
        measures can be incorporated into training and deployment of the model. In recent years, the field of adversarial research in ML
        has grown significantly, providing for new standards to evaluate a model's robustness against adversarial attacks. Finding a completely
        generalized defensive solution is difficult, however creating more fully documented and reproducible attacks doubtlessly will help
        unify and progress defensive strategies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="blog-section magic-box" id="industry-applications">
      <h2>Industry Applications</h2>
      <p>
        The central mechanism used to generate the poisons, called gradient alignment, is a general-purpose relaxation of a difficult bi-level optimization problem. Such problems frequently appear in many different applications, even those not involving any security objective. We will briefly motivate one such example, *dataset condensation*, and describe how gradient alignment can be used to achieve it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the process of learning a new field of study. When the field is nascent, the task of understanding it falls to researchers, who explore the space inefficiently as they attempt to find what does and does not work. As the field matures, however, the knowledge of the field becomes more concentrated, and the task of learning it becomes easier. This is because the knowledge of the field is condensed into a smaller number of papers, which can be read and understood more quickly than the original research. By the time the information reaches the level of a textbook, the knowledge has been refined so that a new reader can understand decades of work in only a couple of months.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dataset condensation (sometimes called dataset distillation) is the process of achieving this same effect in machine learning. The goal is to take a large dataset and condense it into a smaller one, while preserving the performance of a model trained on the original dataset. This is useful when developers wish to retrain a model (for example, on a new architecture) but do not want to incur the large cost of retraining on a large number of samples.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process of dataset condensation can be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, similar to the formulation used in Witches' Brew. The outer problem, which relates to the condensation task, is to minimize the test error of a model trained on a condensed dataset. The inner problem, which relates to the training task, is to minimize the training error of a model trained on the condensed dataset (which is being optimized itself). The outer problem is difficult to solve directly, because it requires full knowledge of the inner problem. Gradient alignment provides an efficient relaxation to this problem: instead of minimizing the test error directly, we minimize the cosine similarity between the original training gradient and the condensed training gradient over some sampling of model parameters.

      <h2>Academic Research Follow-Ups</h2>
      <p>
        The robustness of general machine learning algorithms to data poisoning attacks is still not well-understood. A valuable future research direction would be to characterize precisely in which scenarios and to what extent datasets and learning algorithms are susceptible to poisoning. Some recent work has begun to address this question (<a href="#cite-wang2022">Wang et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#cite-lu2023">Lu et al., 2023</a>), but much more work remains to be done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another important direction is to develop defenses against data poisoning attacks.

      <h2>Peer Review Ratings</h2>
      <p>Strengths: 
        <li>
        Clear conceptual and analytical explanation of gradient matching method used. Provides potential for extended work using the bilevel optimization mechanism becuase of the detailed discussion.
        </li> 
        <li>
        Impressive results in the scaling and transferability of the method; using significantly sized datasets like ImageNet, and showing transfered success on black box models like Google Cloud AutoML.
        </li> 
        <li>
        Clear that the authors made it a goal to make as least invasive an attack as possible. Clearly motivates future work to advance defensive mechanisms against likewise attacks. 
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>Weaknesses:

        <li>
        Authors claim that matching multiple target images at once with the same attack method will yeild comperable results, but fail to give convincing proof that this will hold.
        </li>

        <li>
        The 0.1% metric for percentage of poisoned data generally seems impressive, but when considered for a very large data set like ImageNet it actually seems to be a high volume of data still that will need to be poisoned.
        </li>

        <li>
        Defensive strategies discussed seem to cover basics in the field, but could have further benefitted from a theoretical discussion of what new methods it might take to combat this specific attack. 
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>Rating: 7: Good paper, accept.</p>

      <p>Confidence: 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.</p>
